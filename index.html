				<h2>Hi there!</h2>
				My name is Jessica Wright, but I normally go by my middle name Kali, pronounced like "Kay-lee". I am an imaginative creator, an avid reader, and an idealistic dreamer. I graduated from James Madison University (JMU) in May of 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Media Arts and Design (SMAD) with a concentration in Interactive Design. My experience while earning this degree established me with a skillset in user experience design, as my electives in the SMAD department earned me experience in social marketing. While at JMU I worked as a writer and then copy editor for JMU's yearbook, The Bluestone, enabling me to retain and hone my love and skills in reading and writing. Now that I have moved on from my days of being a student, I would like to utilize these skillsets in a career that I am able to learn and grow with.

However, I also had to take into account business perspectives I had not previously, such as search engine optimization, keyword analysis and distribution, and marketing and advertising strategies.</figcaption>

			<h2 class="hSpace">Copy Writing</h2>
			<p id="copy-about">I have considered myself a writer for as long as I can remember, always loving to read and write and experience the power of words. However, it wasn't until high school that my experience with copy writing began. In freshman year of high school, I submitted a story about a local news anchor to the school newspaper. Out of 25 students, my story was chosen to be featured. The following year, I joined the newspaper as a staff writer, and in the following years became features editor and then managing editor. In college, I joined the yearbook as a writer in my junior year, which is where the following writing samples are from. For my senior year, I was promoted to the position of copy editor. During my time as copy editor, I oversaw a team of five writers over a period of three deadlines. Each deadline I had about 25 stories to edit, and ocassionally would pick up stories when my writers were unable to complete their assignments.</p>
